- Sometimes ourselves are kept out since forgot taking keys, so it is better that there is a way to open the door after the door recognize our faces or our fingerprints.
- When we in the room and someone knocks on the door, walked out of the room and confirmed the identity to open the door causes a lot of trouble. 
- People want to check whether the old and the child are at home to make sure they are out of dangerous at any time.
- It is better that you know who is at home when you are out so that you can ask he/she do you a favor at home.
